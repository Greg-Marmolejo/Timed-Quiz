# Timed-Quiz
As a coding bootcamp student I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress.

Here's what the quiz looks like.

Here's how it works.

* Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.

* Player gets 15 points for answering correctly. Remaining seconds after each question count for a point each towards the score.

* If a question is answered incorrectly, 5 points are subtracted from the timer.

* The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.

* If the user gets a highscore, it will be  saved to local storage.
