# Timed-Quiz
As a coding bootcamp student I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress.

Here's what the quiz looks like.

Here's how it works.

* The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.

* Clicking the start button displays a series of questions.

* Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.

* If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.

* The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.

* After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.
